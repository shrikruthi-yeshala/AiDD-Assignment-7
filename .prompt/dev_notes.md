# AI Development Notes - Personal Website Project

## AI Prompts Used During Development

### Prompt 1: Website Structure Planning
**Prompt:** "Create a professional personal website structure with multiple pages including homepage, about, resume, projects, and contact pages. Include responsive navigation and modern design elements."

**AI Output:** Generated a comprehensive HTML structure with semantic elements, navigation system, and placeholder content for all required pages.

**Decision:** Accepted - The structure provided a solid foundation for the multi-page website with proper semantic HTML and navigation.

### Prompt 2: CSS Styling and Responsive Design
**Prompt:** "Create modern, responsive CSS styling for a personal website with a professional color scheme, mobile-first design, and smooth animations. Include styling for forms, cards, and navigation."

**AI Output:** Generated comprehensive CSS with:
- Modern gradient backgrounds
- Responsive grid layouts
- Professional color scheme (blues and purples)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Form styling with validation states
- Card-based layouts for projects and highlights

**Decision:** Accepted with modifications - Used the base styling but customized colors and spacing to match the professional theme.

### Prompt 3: JavaScript Form Validation
**Prompt:** "Create JavaScript for contact form validation with real-time validation, error messages, and form submission handling. Include validation for required fields, email format, password matching, and minimum length requirements."

**AI Output:** Generated comprehensive form validation including:
- Real-time field validation
- Error message display
- Form submission handling
- Mobile navigation toggle
- Smooth scrolling effects

**Decision:** Accepted - The validation logic was thorough and included all required form validation features.

## 150-Word Reflection on AI-Assisted Development

**Where AI Helped Save Time:**
AI significantly accelerated the initial development process by generating boilerplate code for HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality. The AI provided comprehensive form validation logic that would have taken hours to write manually. The responsive design suggestions and modern CSS techniques saved considerable time in creating a professional-looking website.

**Where AI Made Mistakes:**
The AI occasionally generated overly complex CSS selectors and redundant code that needed cleanup. Some of the initial color schemes were too vibrant for a professional website, requiring manual adjustments. The AI also suggested some accessibility features that weren't fully implemented in the initial output. Intianlly, my information was also all incorrect as AI has written "placeholder" paragraphs even though I uploaded my resume. So I had to go back and manually change all the information in about me and resume. I also prompted AI to redo my whole resume section as it looked nothing like a resume in general. 

**Balancing AI Assistance with Personal Coding:**
I used AI as a starting point for scaffolding but made significant personal modifications to align with the specific requirements. I customized the content to match the actual resume information, adjusted the styling for better professional appearance, and added personal touches like the specific project descriptions. The final code represents a collaboration between AI efficiency and human judgment, ensuring both technical quality and personal authenticity.


ADDING PROJECTS

I had to reprompt AI multiple times about fixing tiny little details like images, image placeholders, right project files being displayed, the option to upload image from the computer etc. It did a very good job fixing every re-prompt in a single try however.
