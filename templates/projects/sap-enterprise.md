# SAP Enterprise Solutions Implementation

Comprehensive ERP rollout combining SAP MM, SD, and PP capabilities to support procure-to-pay, order-to-cash, and make-to-stock flows for a mid-sized manufacturing enterprise.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Stand up a production-ready SAP landscape that mirrors real-world enterprise structure and core business processes.
- **Scope:** Company codes, plants, storage locations, master data, procurement, sales, production, and MRP orchestration.
- **Timeline:** 10-week lab project with staged milestones, demos, and retros.

## Enterprise Architecture

- Modeled organizational hierarchy (company code → plant → storage location) to maintain clean segregation of duties.
- Built 500+ master data records across material master, business partners, and purchasing info records.
- Connected departments to the right approval chains with configurable workflows and tolerance checks.

## Process Deep Dive

### Procure-to-Pay (P2P)

1. Auto-generated purchase requisitions from MRP exceptions.
2. Converted PRs to purchase orders with vendor-specific price conditions and delivery calendars.
3. Managed goods receipt, three-way matching, and invoice posting to close the loop.

### Order-to-Cash (OTC)

- Customer master segmentation for global key accounts.
- Sales order templates with ATP checks and pricing conditions.
- Outbound delivery, picking/packing, post goods issue, and FI-AR billing integration.

### Make-to-Stock Production

- Configured multilevel bills of materials, routing steps, and capacity-constrained work centers.
- Embedded quality inspection points to support audit readiness.
- Scheduled production via MRP runs with exception monitoring and follow-up actions.

## Technical Accelerators

- ABAP utilities to bulk-create materials, purchase orders, and routings from CSV seeds.
- Transportable configuration packages for QA/Prod parity.
- Monitoring dashboards surface MRP exception codes and production throughput.

## Results

- 100% coverage of target business scenarios and 95% system efficiency benchmark in performance tests.
- Reduced master-data maintenance effort by 35% thanks to template-driven ABAP helpers.
- Project artifacts (runbooks, test scripts, SOPs) now serve as onboarding material for future teams.

## Lessons Learned

- Early stakeholder mapping avoids rework when aligning sales and manufacturing priorities.
- Data governance policies must accompany master data creation to prevent drift.
- Visualizing process KPIs alongside transactional screens improves adoption during go-live.
