## Insights & Actions

## What I Learned

- Documenting KPI definitions and business rules up front prevents rework downstream.
- Pre-aggregating heavy DAX calculations into Power Query can cut canvas render time by 25%.
- A strong change management plan (training, office hours, feedback loop) ensures rapid adoption of new BI assets.
