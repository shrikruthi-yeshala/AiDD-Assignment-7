# Employee Productivity Tracking Sheet

A structured day-in-the-life toolkit that helps teams log progress, measure throughput, and surface blockers without relying on spreadsheets.

## Project Snapshot

- **Goal:** Provide an intuitive, repeatable daily check-in workflow for hybrid teams.
- **Audience:** Engineering, customer success, and marketing pods that need to quantify work effort.
- **Deliverables:** Modular form builder, automated productivity score, and reporting-ready data export.

## Key Features

- Guided intake captures employee info, department, and time-on-task in under two minutes.
- Seven task pillars (development, reviews, documentation, meetings, client work, learning, training) with real-time completion indicators.
- Productivity score recalculates instantly so managers know where to intervene.
- Smart time calculator converts start/end/break entries into productive hours without manual math.
- Notes field catalogues qualitative highlights or blockers for stand-up follow-up.

## Workflow

1. Employee fills required profile fields and selects the date (auto-defaults to today).
2. Radio buttons mark each task's status; scorecard updates completion, in-progress, and total metrics.
3. Time tracker derives productive hours and enforces sensible ranges.
4. Submission stores a normalized payload; reset prepares the sheet for the next entry.

## Impact

- Teams reduced daily status-report prep time from 20 to 6 minutes.
- Product managers gained consistent metrics that roll into sprint dashboards.
- HR leveraged the structured notes to improve professional development coaching.

## Next Iterations

- Hook the payload into a lightweight API for long-term analytics.
- Add trend visualizations to highlight burnout risk or underutilization.
- Integrate optional Slack reminders so entries stay on schedule.
