# ServiceNow Platform Automation

End-to-end automation pattern that embeds AI-assisted content generation inside ServiceNow while honoring enterprise-grade governance.

## Project Overview

- **Mission:** Convert structured JSON records into polished HTML artifacts without human touchpoints.
- **Partners:** Customer operations, security, architecture, and conversational AI teams.
- **Release:** v1.0 (December 2024) with active learning roadmap queued.

## Feature Highlights

- AI-driven markup builder powered by Google CCAI contextual cues.
- Reusable ServiceNow components (flows, script includes, UI actions) for easy reuse.
- Observability pack that captures throughput, error types, latency, and system uptime.
- Security-first posture: encrypted transport, MFA, RBAC, compliance-aligned retention.

## Architecture At A Glance

1. **Ingestion** – Validated JSON ingested through ServiceNow tables or API.
2. **AI Processing** – CCAI interprets the payload and returns intent plus layout hints.
3. **HTML Rendering** – Semantic generator produces standards-compliant markup.
4. **QA Layer** – Accessibility, XSS, and syntax checks block regressions.
5. **Delivery** – Audited publish to downstream channels with full traceability.

## Performance Outcomes

- 1,000+ daily conversions with 99.9% system availability.
- 75% faster cycle time and 99.2% output accuracy.
- Zero manual rework during post-launch monitoring period.

## Security & Compliance Snapshot

- TLS 1.3 for ingress/egress, AES-256 at rest.
- Role-based access and MFA enforced for privileged actions.
- Immutable audit logs with retention schedules that satisfy GDPR and CCPA.
- Automated scrubbing of PII from monitoring datasets.

## Looking Ahead

- Broader workflow integrations (ITSM, HRSD, CSM) to expand automation coverage.
- Real-time analytics dashboards and predictive anomaly alerts.
- Multi-format output support (XML/PDF/Markdown) driven by the same core engine.
- Continuous ML training loop to adapt to new content archetypes.
