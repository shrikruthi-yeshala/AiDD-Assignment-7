# ServiceNow AI-Powered Automation

Modernized JSON-to-HTML conversion pipeline that marries ServiceNow automation with Google Contact Center AI (CCAI) to accelerate customer support operations.

## Why It Matters

- Legacy teams were hand-coding HTML email templates from structured JSON exports—slow and error-prone.
- Stakeholders needed a scalable workflow that respected security policies and handled 24/7 volume.
- AI assistance enables smarter context extraction while ServiceNow orchestrates governance.

## Solution Blueprint

- **Platform:** ServiceNow (Flow Designer, Script Includes, Business Rules)
- **AI Engine:** Google CCAI for natural language understanding and transformation hints.
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Glide APIs, REST.
- **Compliance:** TLS 1.3 encrypted transport, role-based ACLs, audit logs, retention policies.

## Core Capabilities

1. **Intelligent Conversion** – JSON payloads automatically mapped to HTML components using decision trees learned from historical templates.
2. **Realtime Validation** – Schema checks, guardrails on unsupported tags, and ethical AI guardrails before persisting output.
3. **Self-Healing Automation** – Retry queues and notification hooks when third-party services degrade.
4. **Observability Dashboard** – Processing metrics (volume, failures, latency) streamed into Now Experience UI for ops teams.

## High-Level Flow

1. Record trigger captures inbound JSON; payload stored in staging table.
2. Script Include invokes CCAI with secure OAuth token, receives structured hints.
3. HTML renderer assembles markup and runs XSS sanitization.
4. QA rules validate accuracy; approved output delivered to downstream channels.

## Impact Metrics

- 75% faster turnaround time for customer-ready assets.
- 99.2% data accuracy across regression suites.
- Zero manual interventions in steady state (24/7 coverage).

## Implementation Notes

- Adopted modular JavaScript utilities so additional formats (Markdown, PDF) can be plugged in.
- Built test harness simulating 200+ JSON permutations to keep quality high as models evolve.
- Instituted bias and drift monitoring to satisfy responsible AI commitments.

## Future Enhancements

- Introduce adaptive learning loop with human feedback scoring.
- Expand analytics to include sentiment from converted content.
- Provide low-code wizard for business users to register new template patterns.
