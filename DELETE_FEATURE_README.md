# Project Updates - Delete Confirmation & Images

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Delete Confirmation Page (`templates/delete.html`)
Created a dedicated confirmation page for deleting projects with:
- **Visual Warning**: Animated warning icon and red color scheme
- **Project Preview**: Shows full project details before deletion
  - Title and description
  - Project image thumbnail
  - Detail page slug (if exists)
  - Creation timestamp
- **Safety Features**: 
  - Clear warning message about permanent deletion
  - Two-step process (click delete → confirm on separate page)
  - Cancel button to go back safely
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### 2. Updated Routes in `app.py`
- Added `delete_confirmation()` route (GET) - Shows confirmation page
- Modified `remove_project()` route (POST) - Handles actual deletion
- Added import for `fetch_project_by_id()` function

### 3. Enhanced DAL Functions (`DAL.py`)
- Added `fetch_project_by_id(project_id)` - Retrieves single project for confirmation page
- Returns `Optional[Mapping[str, str]]` with all project fields

### 4. Updated Projects Page (`templates/projects.html`)
- Changed delete button from inline form to link
- Removed JavaScript confirm dialog
- Links now navigate to `/projects/delete/<id>` confirmation page

### 5. Image Display
Images are already properly configured:
- Located in: `static/images/`
- Displayed in projects table with thumbnails
- Shown in delete confirmation preview

## 🎯 User Flow

**Before:**
```
Projects Page → Click Delete → Confirm Dialog → Deleted
```

**Now:**
```
Projects Page → Click Delete → Confirmation Page → Review Details → Confirm Delete → Deleted
                                              ↓
                                         Cancel → Back to Projects
```

## 🚀 Testing the Changes

1. **Restart Flask server** (if running):
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Navigate to Projects Page**:
   - http://127.0.0.1:5000/projects

3. **Test Delete Flow**:
   - Click "Delete" button on any project
   - Review the confirmation page
   - Verify all project details are shown
   - Try "Cancel" to go back
   - Try "Yes, Delete" to remove project

4. **Verify Images**:
   - Check that project thumbnails display in the table
   - Check that image appears in delete confirmation

## 📝 Notes

- **Images**: Current screenshot files are placeholders. Replace with actual project screenshots for production.
- **Styling**: Delete confirmation page has its own embedded styles for the warning/confirmation UI.
- **Database**: No changes needed - all existing projects work with new delete flow.
- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing projects continue to work; only the delete UI changed.

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Trash/recycle bin for soft deletes
- Undo option after deletion
- Bulk delete functionality
- Export deleted project data before removal
